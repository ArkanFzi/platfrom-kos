# 1. Introduction

## Vision
**Platform Kos** is designed to provide a premium, seamless experience for both property managers and residents. The goal is to digitize the traditional "kos-kosan" management into a modern, high-performance web application.

## Objectives
* **Transparency**: Real-time room availability and clear pricing.
* **Security**: Safe payment transfers and encrypted user data.
* **Modern UX**: A fast, mobile-responsive, and visually elegant interface.

## Scope
The platform handles the entire lifecycle of a tenancy:
1. **Discovery**: Browsing and viewing room details.
2. **Booking**: Reservation with secure payment proof uploads.
3. **Management**: Admin control over rooms, tenants, and finance.
4. **Maintenance**: Automated reminders and status management.
